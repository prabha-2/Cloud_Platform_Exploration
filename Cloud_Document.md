# Cloud Platform Exploration
 
Platforms covered: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Cloudflare
 
## 1. Scope and Approach
 
This document summarises what I learned by reading the official documentation and learning resources of the four platforms. It is an exploration task: no paid cloud resources were created and no purchases were made. Service descriptions reflect the official documentation. Free tier terms, limits and prices change often, so always confirm them on each provider's pricing page before using anything.
 
## 2. Amazon Web Services (AWS)
 
### Overview
 
AWS is the largest and oldest of the general-purpose cloud providers, with the broadest service catalogue. Resources live in Regions, each made of multiple Availability Zones. Most services can be managed through the web console, CLI, SDKs or Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation, Terraform, CDK).
 
### Important services and their purpose
 
- **Compute - EC2:** virtual machines with full control over OS and networking. Used for traditional apps, custom workloads and self-managed software.
- **Compute - Lambda:** serverless functions that run on events (API calls, file uploads, schedules) and bill per execution.
- **Containers - ECS, EKS, ECR, Fargate:** ECS is AWS's own container orchestrator, EKS is managed Kubernetes, ECR is the container image registry, and Fargate runs containers without managing servers.
- **Storage - S3:** object storage for files, backups, static websites and data lakes. EBS provides block storage for EC2 and EFS provides shared file storage.
- **Networking - VPC, Route 53, CloudFront, ELB:** VPC is the private network (subnets, route tables, security groups), Route 53 is DNS, CloudFront is the CDN, and Elastic Load Balancing distributes traffic across targets.
- **Databases - RDS, Aurora, DynamoDB:** RDS is managed relational databases, Aurora is AWS's high-performance relational engine, and DynamoDB is a managed NoSQL key-value store.
- **Security and identity - IAM, KMS, Secrets Manager:** IAM controls who can do what through users, roles and policies. KMS manages encryption keys. Secrets Manager stores credentials and rotates them.
- **Monitoring - CloudWatch, CloudTrail:** CloudWatch collects metrics, logs and alarms. CloudTrail records API activity for auditing.
- **DevOps tooling - CloudFormation, CodePipeline, CodeBuild:** CloudFormation provisions infrastructure from templates. CodePipeline and CodeBuild provide CI/CD.

## 4. Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
 
### Overview
 
GCP is Google's cloud, known for strong data analytics, machine learning and Kubernetes (Google created Kubernetes). Resources are organised into Organization, Folders and Projects, and a Project is the main unit for billing, APIs and access control. Management is available through the console, the gcloud CLI, client libraries and Terraform.
 
### Important services and their purpose
 
- **Compute - Compute Engine:** virtual machines with custom machine types and managed instance groups for scaling.
- **Serverless - Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, App Engine:** Cloud Run runs any container serverlessly and is one of the simplest ways to deploy a containerised service. Cloud Functions runs event-driven code. App Engine is a managed application platform.
- **Containers - GKE, Artifact Registry:** GKE is managed Kubernetes and Artifact Registry stores container images and packages.
- **Storage - Cloud Storage, Persistent Disk, Filestore:** Cloud Storage is object storage, Persistent Disk is block storage, and Filestore is managed NFS.

## 5. Cloudflare
 
### Overview
 
Cloudflare is different from the other three. It started as a CDN, DNS and security provider that sits in front of websites, and it has grown into an edge platform that runs code and stores data across its global network. It is usually used alongside AWS, Azure or GCP rather than as a full replacement for them, although some applications can be built entirely on Cloudflare.
 
### Important services and their purpose
 
- **DNS:** authoritative DNS hosting, usually the entry point for adding a domain to Cloudflare.
- **CDN and caching:** caches content at edge locations close to users to improve speed and reduce load on the origin server.
- **Security - WAF, DDoS protection, Bot management, Rate limiting:** filters malicious traffic before it reaches the origin. DDoS mitigation is part of the core platform.
- **SSL/TLS:** manages certificates and encryption modes between visitor, Cloudflare and origin.
- **Workers:** serverless code that runs at the edge on Cloudflare's network, used for APIs, request routing and edge logic.
- **Pages:** hosting for static sites and full-stack frontends with Git-based deployments.
- **Storage and data - R2, KV, D1, Durable Objects:** R2 is S3-compatible object storage, KV is a global key-value store, D1 is a serverless SQL database, and Durable Objects provide stateful coordination at the edge.
- **Tunnel:** exposes internal services to the internet through an outbound connection, without opening inbound firewall ports.
- **Zero Trust - Access, Gateway:** identity-aware access to applications and secure web gateway features, as an alternative to a traditional VPN.
- **Load Balancing:** traffic distribution and health-check-based failover across origins.

## 7. Key Takeaways
 
- AWS has the widest service range and the largest ecosystem. Its breadth also means more services to learn and more configuration decisions.
- Azure fits best where an organisation already depends on Microsoft identity and tooling (Entra ID, Microsoft 365, Windows workloads).
- GCP is strongest for data analytics (BigQuery), Kubernetes (GKE) and simple container deployment (Cloud Run).
- Cloudflare is mainly an edge, networking and security layer, with a growing developer platform. It complements the other three.
- The core concepts are the same across all four: compute, storage, networking, identity and access, monitoring, and Infrastructure as Code. Knowing them on one platform makes learning another much faster.
- Every provider uses a shared responsibility model: the provider secures the underlying infrastructure and the customer secures configuration, identities and data.
- Cost control matters on every platform. Set budgets and alerts, and delete unused resources.
